This repo contains the files for DXX-Retro. Currently, I only have Windows here. Someday I might expand to other platforms.

You will still need the game content from your purchased copy of Descent and/or Descent II.

If you do no own Descent and Descent II, you can purchase a copy from GOG, Steam, or Ebay.



DXX-Retro is based off DXX-Rebirth 0.58.0
